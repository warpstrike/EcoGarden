# EcoGarden

EcoGarden is a C++ game app project aimed at educating players about ecological
balance and environmental protection. The game is designed to be fun and educational,
allowing players to learn about the balance of an ecosystem while enjoying
a game-based experience.

# Objective
The objective of EcoGarden is to create and maintain a virtual garden while learning
about the importance of ecological balance between species. Players will learn how
different species of plants and animals interact with one another in an ecosystem,
and how their needs and ressources are linked to each other's.

# Gameplay
In EcoGarden, players start by designing their own virtual garden. They can choose
from a variety of plants, trees, and flowers to create their own unique garden.
Players can also add a variety of animals to their garden, such as birds, bees,
spiders, and much more. Each animal has its own unique behavior, which can impact
the player's garden in different ways.

Players must maintain the ecological balance of their garden by ensuring that
eachspecies has the necessary resources to survive. For example, bees will need
flowers to survive, while birds need trees for nesting as well as insects to feed.
Players must also protect their garden from environmental hazards, such as
weather changes, which can harm the plants and animals in the garden.

As players progress through the game, they will unlock new plants and animals.
Players will also receive feedback and tips from the game about how to improve
their garden's ecological balance.
